This is an example workflow description used with the %SYSTEMWEB%.WorkflowPlugin.

See ControlledDocument for a document controlled by this workflow.

Any topic using this workflow can use settings from this topic that start
with =WORKFLOW= - for example,
   * Set WORKFLOWNOTICE = This document is under workflow control

The workflow is a very simple one, with only three states and four
transitions:

<verbatim>
UNDERREVISION ------>-------- PLEASEAPPROVE --->--- APPROVED
       ^      needs approval        |       approve    |
       |                            |                  |
       +------------<---------------'                  |
       |         reject                                |
       |                                               |
       `-------------------------<---------------------'
                               revise
</verbatim>
Anyone can make the =needs approval= and =revise= transitions, but
only the (fictional) !QualityGroup can make the 'approve' and 'reject'
transitions. Further,
   * the document can only be edited in UNDERREVISION state. In all other states, it is locked for editing
   * when a topic is moved to PLEASEAPPROVE state, it gets the ApproveForm
   * when a topic is moved to UNDERREVISION state, it gets the RevisionForm
   * the user who last moved a document to UNDERREVISION is not allowed to move it to APPROVED.
   * WikiGuest is denied most actions unti lthe document is in approved state
   
---++ States
The first table describes the states a topic can be in.

| *State*       | *Allow VIEW*   | *Allow CHANGE* | *Message*            |
| UNDERREVISION | not(WikiGuest) | not(WikiGuest) | Under revision       |
| PLEASEAPPROVE | not(WikiGuest) | nobody         | Waiting for approval |
| APPROVED      |                | nobody         | Approved for release |

--++ Transitions
The second table describes the transitions available from each state.

| *State*        | *Action*       | *Next State*  | *Allowed*      | *Form*       |
| UNDERREVISION  | needs approval | PLEASEAPPROVE | not(WikiGuest) | ApproveForm  |
| APPROVED       | revise         | UNDERREVISION | not(LASTUSER_UNDERREVISION) | RevisionForm |
| PLEASEAPPROVE  | approve        | APPROVED      | QualityGroup   |              |
| PLEASEAPPROVE  | reject         | UNDERREVISION | QualityGroup   | RevisionForm |
